            I have worked on many projects over the years. Below are some that I've highlighted. If you have any thoughts or feedback on them, please feel free to reach out!

        <h3>Grapefruit Forum [<a href="https://github.com/grapefruit-forum">GitHub</a>] âœ¨</h3>
        <p>
            Grapefruit is open source forum software. The backend is written in <a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. It started as my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_study">independent study</a> project at <a href="https://www.odu.edu/">Old Dominion University</a> under Professor <a href="https://www.cs.odu.edu/~tkennedy">Thomas Kennedy</a>, with a main goal of studying and gaining a deeper understanding of the Rust programming language. I am currently working on this project!
