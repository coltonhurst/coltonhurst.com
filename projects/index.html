    <h3>Lessons on the Book of Daniel [2019-2020]</h3>
    <p>
        I've had the honor of preaching through five chapters of the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Daniel">Book of Daniel</a> at <a
            href="https://www.hamptonroadschurch.com/">church</a> for sunday sermons. For family and posterity, the
        links to the lessons are below. These lessons took many hours of prayer, reading, study, and other preparations.
        I hope they point everyone to God and His word. (Note: unfortunately, I didn't do a personal audio recording for
        the first two lessons, so they are currently only available from my church's "Facebook Live" video.)

    <h3>Tink [2007]</h3>
    <p>
        You can download Tink <a href="./Tink.zip">here</a>. It's the first game I ever made; I used <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker_Studio">Game Maker</a> (version 7.0) back in 2007 when I was
        in middle school (because I used the free version of Game Maker, it's Windows only). It's based off of the old
        flash game The World's Hardest Game.
