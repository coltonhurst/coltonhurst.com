        I've had this website for a few years now, but I haven't really <i>done</i> anything with it. I've changed the
        design a dozen times and rewritten it half a dozen times, but there hasn't been any consistent content. At this
        point, it just serves as a <i>nearly</i> empty portfolio. I want that to change, though I'm not yet sure what
        it'll look like in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
        So... what are the goals for the writing on my website? Four quick, fairly unrefined thoughts:
    </p>
    <h3>Sharing What I Learn</h3>
    <p>
        Sharing what I learn is helpful. It will organize my thoughts on a subject, aid someone else in learning
        something new, etc. However, I want to not only share what I learn, but use writing about a topic <i>as</i> the
        end goal, to help me learn more. Do I want to learn how to build a certain piece of software? Great! The fun is
        in the process itself and getting the end product... but writing about it could be my own way of "completing"
        what I set out to learn. The wax stamp sealing the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a lot of great writers out there that do this (these are not new concepts). Julia Evans' <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200408164845/https://jvns.ca/">website</a> is a great example. Her
        blog's theme was once described as "<a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190112145701/https://jvns.ca/about/">things Julia has learned
            recently</a>." She shares what she learns, and it's been helpful enough that she has a meta section titled
        "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200408164845/https://jvns.ca/#on-blogging---speaking">On blogging /
            speaking</a>."
    </p>
    <h3>Becoming a Better Writer</h3>
    <p>
        Writing more will help me become a better writer. (That's basically the <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200408165137/https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tl;dr">tl;dr</a> of all
        "become a better writer!" books.) Having someone read and give constructive feedback would probably be the
        second best thing.
    </p>
    <h3>Content & Quality Goals</h3>
    <p>
        I want to write about two main concepts I am passionate about: spirituality and programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Spirituality" is fairly vague. Mostly, I'd like to write about what I learn from reading the Bible and other
        Bible based books. There are many other topics this could branch to though.
    </p>
    <p>
        Programming is what I currently do as a full time job. Writing about it may look like anything from in-depth
        code discussion, to the importance of having mentors.
    </p>
    <p>
        For both of these topics, I want to write with quality. I'm not a great writer, so in a sense, the quality of my
        writing is directly proportional to the time I put in. The more time I work on a piece, the better it will be,
        and the less time I put in, the worse it will be. I'd like to shoot for somewhere in the middle; quality content
        that I can get out in a few hours. As time goes on, hopefully my time put in will produce a higher value than
        before.
    </p>
    <p>
        Paul Graham's <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200408165258/http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">essays</a> are
        very polished and flow well.
    </p>
    <h3>Getting Good Jobs</h3>
    <p>
        This doesn't need any explanation. Learning, being a better writer, having focused content and high quality are
        all important. If I can, I'd hope this all assists me whenever I'm looking for new work.
    </p>
    <h3>So... what's next?</h3>
    <p>
        When you really want to get something done, you should make something akin to <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200408165503/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART
            goals</a>. I won't do that yet. For now, I'm living life one day at a time.
