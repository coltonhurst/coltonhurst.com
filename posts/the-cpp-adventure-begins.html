    <p>
        This is my first <i>real</i> attempt at starting a blog. I've been fortunate enough to code for over 12
        years now, and I just passed the 3 year mark of writing software full time for a living. One of the biggest
        lessons I've learned along the way is realizing how <i>little</i> I know. It makes me want to learn more, and in
        turn, I learn more about how little I know üòÖ
    </p>
    <p>
        While I'm all for this learning cycle, I can be picky about <i>what</i> I want to learn. Sometimes I have a
        choice, and sometimes I don't (because of previous choices). In this case, I'm finishing my Bachelor of Computer
        Science at <a href="https://www.odu.edu/">Old Dominion University</a>, and whether I like it or not, I have to
        know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>. Because my next year of spare time will largely
        consist of programming in C++, I thought, "Hey, this is a good time to start a blog, and write about what I'm
        learning!" So, here we are.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just to be clear, I'm not starting this because I'm <i>so excited</i> to write about C++. Honestly, I'd much
        rather spend this time on other programming languages. However, without much of a choice, I figured it was a
        good time to start building a new helpful habit; writing about what I'm learning, so that I can understand it
        better, record some of what I've learned, and maybe help others along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of going into more detail about how little I know, how this post and all future ones may not be of any
        help to anyone, or many other disclaimers, I want to link some blogs that I've looked up to and learned a lot
        from. If you're one of the authors below, or one of many others not listed that have helped me in millions of
        other ways, <i>thank you</i> üôè.

        In proper programming fashion, and without any further ado, hello world!

    <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
