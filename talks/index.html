            I'm grateful that I've been able to present talks on various topics in various forms. The talks listed below fall under the umbrella of computer science and software engineering, which relate to my professional work. I also have given many talks, discussions, and sermons from the Bible which are not listed. I am happy to discuss either, and feedback is always welcome!
