            Two small updates...
            <br><br>
            I'm still finishing my degree, but I now officially have 3 classes left! (The current independent study, and then two classes in the fall.) While it's been a great experience, I'm ready to be done.
            <br><br>
            In other news, I recently got a new job! I'm now working remotely as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.shift4.com/">Shift4 Payments</a>, in the <a href="https://www.shift4shop.com/">Shift4Shop</a> division.
