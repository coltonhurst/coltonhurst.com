        <h3>Work</h3>
        <p>
            I'm currently working as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.pdisoftware.com/">PDI Software</a>. Most of my work is done with C#, SQL, and JavaScript / HTML / CSS. By the end of January 2021 I'll have worked there for 4 years! ðŸŽ‰
        </p>
        <h3>School</h3>
        <p>
            I'm in the final stretch of my CS degree at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dominion_University">ODU</a>! Lord willing I'll graduate at the end of Fall 2021. I'm currently finishing up CS 381 (Discrete Structures) and CS 471 (Operating Systems).
        </p>
        <h3>More Important Things...</h3>
        <p>
            In more important (and fun) areas of life, there is a great deal going on! My wife and I are leading a regional teen ministry in our church, I recently spent a weekend in the wilderness, and I'm reading <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Walk_in_the_Woods_(book)">A Walk in the Woods</a></i> + <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowing_God">Knowing God</a></i>. In whatever spare time is left, I've been learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a> and have been doing the Julian Day pushup challenge (today is day 316).
