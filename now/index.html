            Outside of those "big three", I've been reading a lot (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingkiller_Chronicle">The Kingkiller Chronicle</a>), have been slowly getting back into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a> programming, and have been learning how to make homemade bread.
