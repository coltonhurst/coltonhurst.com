            Happy New Year! I'm resting and recovering from 2020, and from all of the pushups I did (I did the Julian Day pushup challenge in 2020, doing a total of 67,161 pushups)!
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm currently working as a software engineer, leading a youth ministry, and completing my Computer Science degree.
