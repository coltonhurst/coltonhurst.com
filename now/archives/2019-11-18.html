    <h2>Now [2019-11-18]</h2>
    <p>
        This is my now page, which explains what I'm currently up to in life. If you have a website, you <a
            href="https://nownownow.com/about">should make one too</a>. My past now pages are also available <a
            href="./index.html">here</a>.

    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>
        I'm still working full time at <a href="https://www.pdisoftware.com/">PDI Software</a> as a software engineer.
        By the end of January 2020, I'll hit the three year mark working there. It's been an amazingly rewarding
        experience; I love the team that I work with, and it's a great environment to be in. The acquisition has been
        challenging (<a href="https://www.pdisoftware.com/news/pdi-acquires-outsite-networks/">Outsite Networks was
            bought by PDI</a> back in Nov 2018), but on the bright side, it's been a huge learning experience, with
        mostly positive benefits.
    </p>
    <h3>School</h3>
    <p>
        I'm nearing the end of my first semester online at <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dominion_University">ODU</a>. I'm currently taking three <a
            href="http://catalog.odu.edu/courses/cs/">classes</a> online: STAT 330, CS 252, and CS 300T. CS 252 is
        probably the most interesting, CS 300T is the easiest, and STAT 330 is definitely the most difficult and time
        consuming. Working full time, going to school, and doing all the other things I have to do is rough. I'm
        learning next-level time management discipline, and I can't wait to be done.
    </p>
    <h3>Church</h3>
    <p>
        My wife and I are currently leading the teens (youth ministry) in our region of the <a
            href="https://www.hamptonroadschurch.com/">Hampton Roads Church</a>. It's been fun and rewarding, and we're
        learning us how to lead and serve, how to deal with issues, and how to help and learn from people in various
        life stages (from middle schoolers to parents). I also have had the opportunity to preach through various
        chapters of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Daniel">Daniel</a>. Learning to preach has taught me
        a <i>lot</i> about public speaking, preparation, and has helped deepen the quality of my Bible study. I'm very
        grateful for the opportunities that have been opened to us; though it's tiring and uncomfortable, I believe
        these things are sharpening our character.
