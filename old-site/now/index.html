    <p>
        This is my now page, which explains what I'm currently up to in life. If you have a website, you <a
            href="https://nownownow.com/about">should make one too</a>. My past now pages are also available <a

    <h3>COVID-19</h3>
    <p>
        The year 2020 has taken a turn that no one could have expected. The world is slowing down and joining forces to
        fight a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic">virus</a> that we cannot
        see. Schools are shut down, public places banned, and the global death count is reaching 100,000. If you are
        reading this (even after this is all over), I encourage you to help others in every way you can. Now is not the
        time to worry about the "I"; it's time to worry about the "we".
    </p>
    <p>
        You can monitor the virus with the <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">COVID-19 tracking website</a>
        that Johns Hopkins is running. At the time of this writing, there are 1,413,415 confirmed cases with 81,200
        deaths around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to help in this fight, there are many nonprofits you can donate to, like <a
            href="https://hopeww.kindful.com/?campaign=1061314">Hope Worldwide</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please stay safe.
