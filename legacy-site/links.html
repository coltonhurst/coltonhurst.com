                <p>
                    This page is dedicated to sharing links to awesome and/or valuable places on the internet. If you have one to recommend, please <a href="mailto:colton@coltonhurst.com">let me know</a>! The links are in alphabetical order, and the list is always growing. There's no real criteria for the list, but many of the links are related to software engineering (I'm biased).
